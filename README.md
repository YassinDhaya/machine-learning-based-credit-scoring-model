# machine-learning-based-credit-scoring-model
This project aims to propose an implementation of machine learning algorithms that classify potential customers based on the financial ratios that are tools to evaluate the performance of their businesses.
The focus of this project was specifically on corporate credit. In order to construct our machine learning model, I collected the data from three previous years of 935 clients
that contain numerous financial ratios that describe the financial situation of these clients, plus the dependent variable of our credit rating model which is the class of each client at
each year. We did not target a specific sector, so the companies belong to different sectors (industrial, commercial, service, etc.) The count of the features that have been collected
reached 39 variables containing Working capital, Working capital requirement, Financial expense coverage ratio, Leverage ratio, Operating cash flow, Financial self-sufficiency ratio, Gearing, Return on equity, Return on assets, current ratio, quick ratio, Operating
profitability, and other variables. We do expect the irrelevance and the possibility of high correlation of some of these variables and we will address these issues next in the preprocessing stage of the data.
